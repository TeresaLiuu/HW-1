            My name is Teresa. I moved to Seattle a year ago from Taiwan. I am here on my adventure. I know nothing
            about Seattle before I moved here. I just picked a place on the map and decided to move. Nothing was wrong
            living in Taiwan. I just wanted to see the world before I am too afraid to leave my comfort zone.
            <br>
            My major in Taiwan was applied foreign language: English. Which apparently is not a foreign language here...
            I still struggle a lot with the cultural differences and English conversations. But this challenge is also
            what I wanted. I would rather challenge myself than live in my comfort zone.
            I believe in no pain, no gain!
